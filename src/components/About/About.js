                What is SafeMammoth?
            </h2>
            <p>
            SafeMammoth is a deflationary cryptocurrency, running on BEP20 network (atleast for now), Every time a transaction happens, 4% of that transaction is burned and redistributed to every MAMMOTH (SafeMammoth HODLers). This increases the scarcity of $SMMTH in ciculation. What this mean is that everytime $SMMTH is	 used, the price of $SMMTH will continue to rise as the number of circulating token is drastically decreasing.
